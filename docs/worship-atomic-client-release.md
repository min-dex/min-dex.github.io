# Atomic Client Preparation

Historical preparation record. For the current enabled client boundary, see
[Current Worship Persistence Contract](worship-persistence-current.md).
The rollout/grant statements below describe the preparation stage, not a fresh
inspection of current database permissions.

2026-09-22: the additive production migration is installed and the live aggregate
read RPC matches REST. `MINDEX_WORSHIP_ATOMIC_PROTOCOL` is enabled in index.html;
existing write permissions remain available until the client deployment and
reviewed save are verified.

## Included

- Opt-in aggregate read and RPC adapters for full save, element Apply, sibling
  edit synchronization, creation, deletion, scheduling and live setlist leaders.
- Tab-scoped immutable pending requests, exact retries, revision checks and
  preservation of unrelated/in-flight local drafts.
- Stable creation identities and original child UUIDs/calendar seeds on retry.
- Independent service transactions in creation batches; confirmed services are
  retained when a later service fails.
- Atomic-mode automatic cleanup skips populated or locally edited services.
- Removal of the uncalled old shared-write helper pair. Active edit-time sync
  remains in place. Its legacy branch constructs the document before writes.
- Desktop packaging includes the two dynamically imported runtime modules.

The production path now selects the aggregate RPC protocol. Legacy permissions
remain temporarily available as an operational rollback path, but the enabled
client does not fall back to direct writes after an RPC failure.

## Verification

The actual deployed app functions are exercised offline by
`tests/smoke_atomic_save_runtime.py` and `tests/smoke_atomic_lifecycle.py` in
Chromium and WebKit. Their exported requests are replayed in disposable
PostgreSQL 17.6 with `tests/test_worship_atomic_prototype.mjs`, using optional
`WORSHIP_RUNTIME_FIXTURES` and `WORSHIP_LIFECYCLE_FIXTURES` paths.
The SQL under tests/fixtures is private test code, never a production migration.

Coverage includes rollback, same-revision competition, lost-response retries,
document ownership/date checks, source/target isolation and creation/deletion.
Existing default-path save, edit-sync and presenter regressions are also run.

## Activation Gates

Production SECURITY DEFINER ownership/grants and public RPCs, revision handling
for external canonical mutations, recovery/retention policy, pending/conflict UI,
coordinated old-client denial and live operational verification remain required.
Do not enable the switch or revoke DML merely because this client is deployed.

Local follow-up: named RPC argument compatibility and private checkpoint recovery
are now exercised in PostgreSQL; see [security checks](worship-atomic-security-check.md)
and [recovery checks](worship-atomic-recovery-check.md). These tests do not satisfy
the production catalog, operational backup restore, UI or cutover gates above.

The refreshed [live audit and staged conflict review](worship-atomic-live-audit-20260919.md)
records actual production schema/permission findings. Conflict review preserves
drafts, supports comparison/export and explicit archive-before-reopen. Source text
can be deliberately reapplied using the recovery picker; no automatic merge is
performed. The atomic client is enabled after the production aggregate read check.
